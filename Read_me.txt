## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that most of the members are casual members with 61.1% of the total members while 38.9% are members.
Also most of the bike type used in the race is electric bike.
The duration of the trips varies from several minutes to days.
From the Location plots that represent the trip start and end location,we observe that the trip start and end at the the same location.
Most of the trips were done by electric bikes in the last week of May 2020.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the bike types used and the membership and the duration of each trip.
The questions addressed from the explorartory analysis are:
Q1:What is the most used bike type?
Most of the bikes used are "Electric bikes"

Q2:What is the most membership type participate in races?
Most of the members in the races are "casual" members

Q3: What is the duration of each trip?
The trips duration varies from 14 minutes to 23 days.

By observing the start and end trip locations we observe that the trip start and end at the the same location.

From plotting the graphs we noticed that most of the bikes used is the electric_bike while most of the participants is a 'casual' member and most of the trips were done by electric bikes in the last week of May 2020.
